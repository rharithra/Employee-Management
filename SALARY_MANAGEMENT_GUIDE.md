## Salary Calculation Process

### Gross Salary Calculation
```
Gross Salary = Basic Salary + Total Allowances
Total Allowances = HRA + DA + TA + Performance Incentive + Special Allowance + Medical Allowance + Conveyance Allowance + Food Allowance + Other Allowances
```

### Net Salary Calculation
```
Net Salary = Gross Salary - Total Deductions
Total Deductions = PF + Tax
```

### Payroll Generation
When generating payroll:
1. **Working Days Calculation**
   - Total working days for the month (usually 22)
   - Actual working days = Total days - Leave days taken
   - Leave deduction = (Leave days ร Daily rate)

2. **Final Salary**
   - Final Net Salary = Net Salary - Leave Deduction
   - Daily rate = Net Salary รท Working days

## Best Practices

### 1. Initial Setup

- Use individual salary editing for performance-based adjustments
- Keep performance incentives separate from fixed allowances
